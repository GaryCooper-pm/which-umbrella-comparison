                    <strong>What information is collected and why?</strong>
                    In order to establish a client relationship with you we are obliged under various Isle of Man Legislation and guidance to verify your identity. We will do this by asking you to provide documents such as an application form (for investment management services) a copy of your passport or identity card, proof of your address and tax status and the source of your investment funds and general wealth. We may also refer to specific online data bases or websites to assist us in verifying the information you have provided. When you telephone Which Umbrellaplease note that your call may be recorded.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How is it collected?</strong>
                    The information will be provided by you direct or via an agent acting on your behalf. Normally this will be by post, however, more recently emailed and scanned documents have been deemed acceptable in certain circumstances.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How will it be used?</strong>
                    We will use the data to establish an account in your name and to manage that account going forward, including providing updates or information in relation to your account, our services, the investment markets or changes to our terms and conditions. You have the option on your application form to confirm how you wish us to contact you and can update these preferences at any time by contacting us.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How long will it be kept?</strong>
                    Isle of Man regulations state that information must be retained for at least 6 years from the end of your relationship with Which Umbrella. If appropriate after that time, it will be destroyed so that it is not retained for longer than necessary.

                <li>
                    <strong>Who it will be shared with?</strong>
                    We may disclose your personal information to our agents, nominees, custodians and our associates for the purposes of effectively managing your account with us. We will not share your information with any other third party unless obliged to do so by law.
